/**
 * TODO EXPLANATION
 * In Computer Science, a divide and conquer is a type of algorithm designed to break down a problem into sub-problems
 * which are usually simple enough to be solved directly. These solution to sub-problems can be combined to give our final answer.
 * The Divide and Conquer technique can be understood as three parts :
 * Divide —Dividing the problem into sub-problems
 * Conquer — Conquering the sub-problems by solving them recursively.
 * Combine — Combining all the solutions to sub-problems and merging them into solution of our original problem.
