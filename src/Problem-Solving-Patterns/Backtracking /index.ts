/**
 * TODO EXPLANATION
 * Backtracking is a technique based on algorithm to solve problem. It uses recursive calling to find the solution by
 * building a solution step by step increasing values with time. It removes the solutions that doesn't give rise
 * to the solution of the problem based on the constraints given to solve the problem.
 * Backtracking algorithm is applied to some specific types of problems
 * 1. Decision problem used to find a feasible solution of the problem.
 * 2. Optimisation problem used to find the best solution that can be applied.
 * 3. Enumeration problem used to find the set of all feasible solutions of the problem
