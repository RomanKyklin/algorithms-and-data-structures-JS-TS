/**
 * TODO EXPLANATION
 * Dynamic programming is a technique to solve problems by breaking it down into a collection of sub-problems,
 * solving each of those sub-problems just once and storing these solutions inside the cache memory in case the same
 * problem occurs the next time. Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion . Wherever we see a
 * recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming.
 * This simple optimization reduces the time complexities from exponential to polynomial.
